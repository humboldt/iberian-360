# VR record of my tour in Iberian

This is a low cost solution:

* Use Google Street View to shoot 360 images. The software helps one to take multiple images to all directions and assemble them into one **spherical** image.
* Use `aframe`'s "sky" element (think of it as "background" in the 2D world) to present the 360 photo on the web.

Add any other interactions as you wish, just like a usual web project.
